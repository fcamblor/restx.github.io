Today we are very happy to announce release 0.35 of RESTX, the lightweight, modular, feature rich, blazing fast and open source Java REST framework.

## New and Noteworthy

### Better cold classes management ([PR #175](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/175))

Several new things have been added about cold classes :
- It permits to add inherited classes of cold components (components being loaded in the main factory, such as AutoStartable ones) in cold classes list.
- It adds a way to declare cold classes using a property: `restx.cold.classes`. The property value is a list of fqcn separated by `,`.
- It adds a way to declare cold classes using a resource file: `META-INF/cold-classes.list`. Resources will be loaded from the classloader, and every classes listed will be added to the cold classes list. The file must contains a list of fqcn, one per line.
- It provides a way to fulfil the resource file using a new annotation: `@Cold`. So every classes annotated with `@Cold` will be added to the resource file.

### [breaking] Security roles are now interpolated ([PR #223](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/223))

Security roles used in `@RolesAllowed` annotation can now be interpolated with `query parameters` and `path parameters`.

For example :
```
@GET("/security/{companyId}/{subCompanyId}")
@RolesAllowed("EDIT_COMPANY_{companyId}_{subCompanyId}")
public String editSubCompany(String companyId, String subCompanyId){
    // ....
}
```

Also, you can add `wildcarded roles` to your principal, such as `EDIT_COMPANY_1234_*` : the special `*` in role name will match `any role parameter value`
meaning user having role `EDIT_COMPANY_1234_*` will be able to call any `/security/1234/*` url without hitting any `403 FORBIDDEN` response.

This feature may be particularly of interest if you are able to generate the whole security roles attached to a user when he authenticates.
An example usage of such role definition & usage may be found in the `samplest`'s 
[`CompanyAndSubCompanyRoles`](https://github.com/fcamblor/restx/blob/master/restx-samplest/src/main/java/samplest/security/CompanyAndSubCompanyRoles.java) enum 
and [`SecuredResource`](https://github.com/fcamblor/restx/blob/master/restx-samplest/src/main/java/samplest/security/SecuredResource.java#L21) 
and [`principals`](https://github.com/fcamblor/restx/blob/master/restx-samplest/src/main/java/samplest/AppModule.java#L25) declarations.


### Unified and improved Query, Path and Body params handling ([PR #177](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/177))

`Query` & `Path` parameters are now both handled through `MainStringConverter`, itself based on `Jackson` registered deserializers.

It means you can now use more complex types than `String` as input endpoint parameters, like `List<Foo>`, `Iterable<Foo>` or `Foo[]`.

Parameterized types handling (based on generics) in every types of parameters (`path`, `query`, `body`) have been 
greatly improved, supporting any level of generics, for instance something like 
[`Map<Boolean, Map<Tuple<String,Tuple<Integer,Float>,String>,String>>`](https://github.com/restx/restx/blob/master/restx-core-annotation-processor/src/test/java/restx/annotations/processor/TypeHelperTest.java#L49)

`Optional` support has been improved on parameters :
- allowing to take generics parameterized types (like `Optional<List<Long>>`)
- `Body` content and `Path` parameters can now be `Optional`
- as before, non-`Optional` parameters are implicitely mandatory, no matter its parameter type

Because of those important changes, if you implemented your own `StdEntityRoutes`, you will likely have to change
a lot of stuff :
- you will have to pass a `EndpointParameterMapperRegistry` and declare an array of `ParamDef`s in `StdEntityRoute`'s constructor
- you will have to resolve input endpoint parameter differently: have a look at a generated `ResourceRouter` class taking the same parameters
  in order to know how to handle those input endpoint parameters.

  was suggesting a security flaw
- [6529fad](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/6529fad) introduced `domain` & `secure` flags on 
 `RestxSessionCookieDescriptor` allowing to further customize generated cookies, keeping previous default values.


### VALIDATION

## Getting started / Upgrading

Want to get started now? Check out the [related doc](/docs/getting-started.html).

Upgrading from an earlier version?

- in your projects you just need to update `restx.version` to 0.35 in your dependency descriptor
- in your code you might have to adapt to some breaking changes (see below)
- in the shell, run `shell upgrade` to upgrade your shell and plugins.

## MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES

Those breaking are likely to be hit by any existing RestX project. Consider those as a "migration guide" to apply on your project :
- Some libraries have evolved :
  - [2bab182](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/2bab182) upgraded guava from 17.0 to 18.0. See [guava 18 release note](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Release18).
  - [9e56b1f](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/9e56b1f) upgraded jongo from 1.0 to 1.3.0. See [jongo release note](http://jongo.org/#release-notes).
  - [515d8e8](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/515d8e8) upgraded jackson from 2.3.3 to 2.8.10 ([latest `2.8.X` version](https://twitter.com/fasterxml/status/900597086793617408)).
    See [jackson release notes](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.8.10).
- If you implemented your own routes :
  - [58f190a](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/58f190a) `RestxRequestMatcher` should be passed to `RestxSecurityManager`
  - [4f61fd2](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/4f61fd2) considering a StdEntityRoute should *always* bring a permissionFactory at construction time
  - [PR #177](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/177) `StdEntityRoute` constructor and input parameters mapping have evolved
    (have a look at the `Unified and improved Query, Path and Body params handling` section)
- [ba28876](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/ba28876) `Permissions` utility class has been replaced by `PermissionFactory` component
- [449b870](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/449b870) `DELETE` endpoint parameters should be looked up in `QUERY` 
  param instead of `BODY` content when no `@Param` is provided (default behaviour)
- [46f8b58](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/46f8b58) principal cached roles are cleared upon logout
- [8c14dff](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/8c14dff) `GET /sessions/current` returns `404 Not found` instead of 
  `200 OK` when no session is defined for current request
- [9a93edf](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/9a93edf) Renamed `restx-server-jetty` artefact to `restx-server-jetty8`


## MINOR BREAKING CHANGES

Those breaking change are unlikely to happen as it is happening on very rare/specific cases.

Anyway, this is worth noting it in case you would be in those cases :
- [460715b](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/460715b) Name are a String+Type instead of a String+Class
- [ceb7a5b](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/ceb7a5b) FactoryMachine.nameBuildableComponents use Type (instead of Class)
- [58f190a](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/58f190a) if you implemented your own `RestxSecurityManager`, you will 
  have to update `check()` prototype to take a `RestxRequestMatcher`
- [f3e51cf](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/f3e51cf) if you implemented your own `Permission` implementation, you 
  will have to update `has()` prototype to take a `Map<String, String> roleInterpolationMap` parameter
- [f3e51cf](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/f3e51cf) if you relied on `Permissions` utility class, you will have 
  to pass an additionnal `Map<String, String> roleInterpolationMap` parameter to method calls
- [44e142c](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/44e142c) if you were using brackets ({}) in your roles, those will 
  now be interpolated
- [2afa00b](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/2afa00b) if you provided your own `Messages` implementation, you 
  will have to provide a `Iterable<String> keys(Locale)` with same impl than `Iterable<String> keys()`
- [0576682](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/0576682) if you provided your own `MutableMessages` implementation, don't
  forget to invalidate cached keys when you mutate your `MutableMessages` instance (most of the time in `setMessageTemplate()`)
- [9effdfd](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/9effdfd) `ResourcesRoute` doesn't allow to serve resources from root
  classpath as it is considered a security flaw
